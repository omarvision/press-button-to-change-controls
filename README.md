# press-button-to-change-controls
Imagine you have a game situation where you want to change the control scheme by pressing a UI Button? One button changes the controls to keyboard and one button changes controls to mouse. The buttons can be on a menu screen. They buttons can even be on the game screen itself.   Press a button, the button will set a value of a variable in a static script (a static script holds its values no matter what scene is loaded).  That variable can then be looked at in the player script. In the player script Update function we can switch on the global variable to run controls as keyboard or mouse.  See how its done in this video!
